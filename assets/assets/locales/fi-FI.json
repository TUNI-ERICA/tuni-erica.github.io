      "info_shaken_baby":"If there are all risk factors concerning the combination measuring the shaken baby syndrome in section, very small children in the family and domestic violence in the family or 1 or statement no. 3 in the section 2, advise will be displayed as follows: “Twin babies, premature babies, very young babies and baby boys are known to be in heightened risk of severe physical maltreatment called Shaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma. It means violent shaking or impact of an infant. The baby may be perceived by caregiver as irritable, difficult to handle or persistently crying, having colic problem or be hyperactive. The risk heightens even more if there is substance abuse or domestic violence in the family. Violence against the baby usually happens because of caregiver’s unrealistic expectations of baby’s ability to control their own behaviour or hopelessness and inability to cope with challenging child-caregiver relationship. The fact is that the baby’s ill condition after shaking or impacting is often severe and irreversible causing lifelong injuries and disability. Therefore, it is critical to acknowledge this and seek help preventively. If the situation with your child seem to be challenging, and you are not able to overcome it, please seek support, have a discussion with your spouse, close relatives or contact your regions closest health care professional, public health care nurse in the family centre, social worker, day care teacher or voluntary agency professional to be able to assess your and your family’s possible support needs.
