        "info":"This application is intended for use by expectant parents, parents or caregivers with children or other adults' who want to think about the safety and welfare in their own family. The purpose is to help you to ponder about the present situation of your own, your children and of the whole family and to identify a possible need for the change or for early support. The objective of the application is to increase your research-based knowledge about the factors which promote safety and welfare as well as the factors which weaken them. Furthermore, the application contains service information and useful links through which you get to the sources of additional information about the early support for the families with children.\n\nMany matters affect safety and welfare separately and together. All the families meet several challenges in their life. They are connected, among others, to the pregnancy, child birth, growth, child rearing, schooling, to the intimate partner relationship and its development, family relationships, to working life, leisure, hobbies, to the illnesses. The list is long. The challenges can be positive or negative, anticipated or unpredictable, or a quick pass or a recurring. The challenges may develop into the insuperable trouble especially when they drag on. The family may lack factors which protect safety and welfare like the support of the society or of the close relatives, ability to manage a difficult situation or lack of the information about how to act the best way in difficult situations. The children are the most vulnerable and have symptoms when they feel insecure. Be courageous and act early! If you have concerns about the safety and well-being of yourself, your child or another family member, or you need information about services such as families, this app provides you with a low threshold to contact these services.\n\nThis application was developed as part of a European research project to promote a non-violent future for children and families. The application is intended only to support your own personal reflection and its information will not be passed on to other parties. If you wish, you can at the end print out your answers for later use. The data will not be saved anywhere and will be lost when you exit the application (Privacy Statement here).\n\nA few background information is asked at the beginning of the application. They are followed by 55 statements, which are answered yes or no. The statements are based on research knowledge and cover a wide range of security challenges in family life. For your part, the purpose is to consider for each statement whether it is true for you or not. It’s a good idea to be fairly honest with yourself, because at the end of the statement section, you will receive feedback based on your answers, which includes research-based information about risk factors, protective factors, and service offerings to support your reflection. Now, find a quiet place and start your reflection trip.",

Past life experiences of caring for and nurturing are often the result of a safe and healthy childhood family life. For many young parents, their own emotional, social, and cognitive development is still in progress, and as a result, it can sometimes be difficult to be a mature, calm, and well-off parent. Survival skills are resources and the ability to control mood and emotions, thoughts, actions, desires, social relationships, and living conditions. Skills are used to solve everyday challenges or to ask for help if one's own resources are not enough. It is very important for young parents to have support for both their own growth and the safe and healthy growth of the child. Please ask help from family members, close associates, or social and health care professionals in your municipality. You can also take advantage of low-threshold child and family services.

On the other hand, a difference can be a harrowing experience if one decides to leave a shared home. Divorce is always somehow shocking to all family members, but especially to children because they love both their parents unconditionally and don’t understand why the family breaks up. In a divorce situation, it is important that children can maintain a healthy relationship with both parents when possible. It is very harmful for children to listen and watch their parents quarrel, bully or experience intentional isolation from the other parent. Therefore, it is essential for adults to receive support and information about parenting after a divorce. The most important thing is to maintain a safe atmosphere in the family, as well as open and warm relationships. There are many services and information for divorced families on how to cope with this stressful and suffering life event. Information is also available for children (links).",

You may be aware that each person has an individual temperament that later becomes a person’s personality. Temperament is a set of abilities, tendencies and reaction styles e.g., activity, sluggishness, sociality, tendency to resentment and irritability. Babies may express their temperament as irritable, but cannot control their reactions. Babies and young children are therefore the most fragile and defenceless. A tired or exhausted parent may become frustrated and experience inadequacy if the baby is very irritable and demanding. It is possible that a frustrated parent is prone to harm the child when trying to control the baby’s irritation. A baby or very small child can get permanent lifelong injuries or even die as a result of violence. It is important to get information about temperament and their differences (link) and about the safe handling of the baby (link). If you have any concerns, please ask advice or support from the local professional to you, for example public health care nurse in the family centre, social worker, day care teacher or voluntary agency professional if you are in doubt of any child or family life matters, big or small. The key is to act early before the worries turns into grief. Need help urgently? Call or contact (number or link).",

      "info_shaken_baby":"Twin babies, premature babies and baby boys in particular are known to be at increased risk of being subjected to physical violence. However, this does not rule out abuse of other small babies. Shaking is often talked about in small babies. It means violently shaking an infant. The baby may be challenging in temperament (link) or may have a health problem such as stomach symptoms. A parent may find the baby irritable, overactive, or otherwise difficult to handle. A parent may have unrealistic expectations about the baby’s ability to control their own behaviour, or the parent will feel hopeless when he or she feels unable to cope with the challenging situation. The risk of shaking is further increased if there is substance abuse or domestic violence in the family. The fact is that the consequences of baby shaking are often very serious and irreversible. Shaking is violence against the baby and can cause lifelong injuries and disability. Therefore, it is critical to acknowledge this and seek help preventively. If the situation with your child seem to be challenging, and you are not able to overcome it, please seek support, have a discussion with your spouse, close relatives or contact your regions closest health care professional, public health care nurse in the family centre, social worker, day care teacher or voluntary agency professional to be able to assess your and your family’s possible support needs. You can read more about the shaken baby syndrome here (link)."
